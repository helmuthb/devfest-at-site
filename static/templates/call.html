<h3>{% trans %}Type of Sessions{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>
{% trans %}
We are planning three type of sessions: talks, workshops, and lightning talks.
{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
{% trans %}
A regular <em>talk</em> (e.g. presentation, tech talk, etc) is supposed to
take about 50 minutes with some minutes afterwards for questions and answers.
{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
{% trans %}
A <em>workshop</em> can either take about 50 minutes, and it can take a
total of 110 minutes, ideally for more in-depth hands-on sessions.
{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>
{% trans %}
In addition, there is the opportunity for <em>lightning talks</em> of much
shorter duration (five minutes and some minutes for questions &amp; answers).
They are ideal for presenting an idea without going too much into technical
details.
{% endtrans %}
</p>
<h3>{% trans %}Language of the sessions{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>
{% trans %}
DevFest Vienna will have sessions in both German and English.
Please let us know your preference and the sessions will be annouced
accordingly.

<h3>{% trans %}Participant requirements{% endtrans %}</h3>
<p>

frameworks should however be announced in advance.
{% endtrans %}
</p>
<p>

have installed on their notebook PCs before attending.
At the same time, expect some time at the beginning of the workshop
